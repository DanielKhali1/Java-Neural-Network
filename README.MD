# Java Neural Network
This is a simple Neural Network program that uses my own neural
network to calculate the value of the XOR operator between two numbers.

You are more than welcome to copy, change, delete whatever you want
from here. It is completely free for any legal uses. This requires no
extra libraries or downloads. All you'll need is the two classes,
`NeuralNetwork` and `Mat`. Once those are in the project, you'll be able to recreate `NeuralNetworkTest`

Here is some example output of that test class
```
Test: [0, 0] -> [0.006182590446436232]  
Test: [0, 1] -> [0.9452036838294252]  
Test: [1, 0] -> [0.9451160797305956]  
Test: [1, 1] -> [0.0030801356534343265]
